                <p>MiSide is a psychological horror game with an interesting plotline. You play as Player One, a protagonist trapped in a virtual world by a twisted game character, Mita. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter various versions of the character in different game worlds, each with its own distinct personality.</p><br>
                <p>The game also has plenty of collectibles that players can hunt down. You can collect cartridges for the different Mitas you meet on your journey, which give you some additional backstory for each character. And if you manage to nab them all, you'll also get an in-game achievement for your efforts. But then again, these cartridges are pretty well-hidden, making it difficult for players to collect them all on their first playthrough. In this guide, we'll give you the exact location for all Mita Cartridges in MiSide so you don't have any trouble picking them up as you play the game.</p><br>
                <h1 class="header">All Mita Cartridges Locations in MiSide</h1>
                <img src="Web Design Assets/Article/ArticleSample7.avif" alt="All cartridges">
                <p>There are a total of 13 Mita Cartridges that players will have to collect to unlock the Hi, Mita achievement in MiSide. These cartridges are spread throughout the chapters, cleverly hidden in easily overlooked places. Thankfully, if you miss a few during your first playthrough, you can load into any chapters to replay them and pick up the cartridge to work towards the achievement.</p><br>
                <p>The following table will show you the exact location of all the Mita Cartridges in the game.</p>

                                The Chapter Mini Mita starts with Player One arriving in front of a miniature house/forge where they meet Chibi Mita. 
                                You'll have to forge a Giant Key with her help, but before you do that, head towards the stool on the left to pick up 
                                the Chibi Mita Cartridge.

                                As you progress through the chapter Mini Mita, you'll eventually arrive at the house in the game version 1.15. Head to the bedroom 
                                where you'll find a Dummy Mita sitting ominously on a chair. When you approach her, she will jump up and bite your hand. 
                                Once the cutscene ends, pick up the Mita Cartridge that's sitting on the nearby table with the mirror.

                                Of all the Mita's you encounter, Kind Mita is pretty much the only one who's actively looking out for you. You'll find her character cartridge 
                                much later in the chapter Reboot. After the scary encounter with Crazy Mita in the Bathroom, things will go back to normal. 
                                At this point, go back to the bedroom to find the Kind Mita cartridge on the computer desk.

                                You'll first encounter Cap-Wearing Mita, or Cappie for short, in the chapter Beyond the World. You'll also find her Cartridge in the 
                                same chapter. After Kind Mita takes your ring and asks you to spend some time with Cappie, head to the Kitchen past the Living Room 
                                and walk over to the TV set. The Mita Cartridge will be sitting on top of it.

                                Dummies and Forgotten Puzzles is a scary level where you'll have to escape hordes of Dummy Mitas. Near the end of this chapter, you'll arrive at a ladder in a sewer area. You'll find the cartridge for Dummy Mita in one of the Dummy Mita's hands before going up the ladder.

                                This one is very easy to miss. In the chapter Novels, you get transported to 2D Mita's world, which plays out like a visual novel. At one point, you'll have a choice to go to either the kitchen or the bedroom. Choose to go into the kitchen first. You'll now have a small window to click on the 2D Mita Cartridge that's sitting on top of the side table under the window.

                                The Mila Character Cartridge is another easy one to collect. Once you're free to move around, head to the living room and you'll find the cartridge on the coffee table in front of the TV.

A moment later, everything will turn dark, and you'll wake up in the kitchen with Creepy Mita staring you down. Ignore Creepy Mita and walk over to the kitchen counter to find the Creepy Mita Cartridge near the fruit bowl.
